        About Me
    </h1>
    <p>
        Hello My name is Curtrick Walton.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am 23 years old and I currently live in Cordova, Tn. <br>I graduated from WhiteStation HighSchool back in
        2016.<br> I mostly like to play games in my free time mostly fps or mmos.
    </p>
    <p>
        I wanted to start learning how to code after my older brother kept telling me to do it because he saw how much I
        liked computers.<br>After looking into it at first I was very confused about all the thing a software developer
        did but after learning it cleared up a lot of questions that I had. <br>After learning about how the world is
        moving closer to tech and how much people are pay for software developer, I just wanted to give it a shot and
        try it out.
    </p>
